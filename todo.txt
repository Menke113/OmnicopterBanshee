- get the code to initialize the ESCs integrated
- make loop that checks for the arming signal (throttle down + switch flip triggers the ESCs to be initialized)
optimization formulations: linear, quadratic, and paired quadratic + linear with extra constraints added to keep omegas the same for
motor pairs
- parse data from sensors into arrays
- find out how to automatically configure motor pins to PWM - done
- start FC software automatically upon being plugged in - done
- find approximations for thrust coefficients of motor/prop pairs (can use reference numbers for similarly specced motors and props)
- measure optimization timing and choose an update rate for each version of the FC software
- code to use the distance sensors and the gravity vector from the accelerometer to corect attitude for landing, if possible, or a way to manually input attitude adjustment
- intregrator code
- heartbeat and automatic check for out of bounds state vector abort contigencies
- save blackbox log data - done
- math/dynamic model of vehicle to get desired thrust, torque
